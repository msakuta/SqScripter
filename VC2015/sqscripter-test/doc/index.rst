Welcome to Sqreeps API Documentation!
=====================================

Sqreeps is a game about scripting.
You write a source code in a scripting language and control the game.
In this game, scripting API is the most important thing to play.


Execution Model
===============

Sqreeps has a data model similar to Screeps.
Simulation runs in real time and the only way the player can interact with the simulation is
via scripting.

You can retrieve current status of the game and place commands to the units he/she is controlling.
